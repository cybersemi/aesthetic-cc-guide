🌸 A lovingly crafted, all-in-one guide for the ISC2 Certified in Cybersecurity exam. ✨
💖 What Even is ISC2?
Imagine a super prestigious club for the world's top cybersecurity experts. That's (ISC)² – the International Information System Security Certification Consortium (a mouthful, we know!). They create the rules and certifications that everyone in the industry respects. Getting a cert from them is a huge deal!

Their entry-level certification is the Certified in Cybersecurity (CC). It's perfect if you're new to the field and want to prove you know your stuff. It's like your golden ticket to starting an amazing career!

📚 The Domains: Broken Down & Beautified
Here are the five domains, explained simply, with key terms defined. This is your note section!

1. 🛡️ Domain 1: Security Principles (28%)
The "Duh, Obviously" Stuff

Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability (CIA Triad): The heart of everything.

Confidentiality: Keeping secrets secret. No unauthorized access. (Think: encryption).

Integrity: Trusting your data is accurate and hasn't been messed with. (Think: hashing).

Availability: Making sure information and systems are there when you need them. (The opposite of a downtime outage).

Security Controls:

Technical: Tech stuff! (Firewalls, antivirus software).

Administrative: Policies and rules. (Employee training, security policies).

Physical: Touchable stuff! (Locks, badge readers, security guards).

Risk Management: The process of finding bad things that could happen (threats) and figuring out how to deal with them.

Risk = Threat x Vulnerability

2. 🚨 Domain 2: Incident Response, BC, and DR (17%)
The "Oh No!" Plan

Incident Response: The step-by-step plan for when you get hacked.

Preparation: Getting ready (having a team, tools).

Detection & Analysis: "Uh oh, something's wrong!" Figuring out what happened.

Containment, Eradication & Recovery: Stopping the bad thing, kicking it out, and fixing everything.

Post-Incident Activity: Learning from the mess so it doesn't happen again.

Business Continuity (BC): How a business keeps running during a disaster (e.g., using a backup office).

Disaster Recovery (DR): How a business gets its tech and data back after a disaster (e.g., restoring from backups).

3. 🔐 Domain 3: Access Controls (22%)
The "Bouncer at the Club"

Identification: Who are you? (Your username).

Authentication: Prove it! (Your password, fingerprint, MFA code).

Authorization: What are you allowed to do? (Read a file? Edit it? Delete it?).

Accountability: Tracking what you did (Logs and audits).

Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA): Using more than one thing to prove your identity. (Password + a code from your phone). This is super important!

4. 🌐 Domain 4: Network Security (15%)
The "Digital Fortress"

Firewall: A wall that blocks unauthorized traffic. The gatekeeper of the network.

Router: Directs traffic between different networks (like a traffic cop for the internet).

Switch: Connects devices within the same network.

Cloud Security: Security for stuff that isn't on your own physical computers (like AWS, Azure, Google Cloud). Shared Responsibility Model is key here!

Wireless Security: WPA2 or WPA3 are the good, secure protocols for Wi-Fi. Never use WEP!

5. 📋 Domain 5: Security Operations (18%)
The "Day-to-Day Grind"

Logging & Monitoring: Watching what happens on the network to spot weird stuff.

Security Awareness Training: Teaching employees not to click on phishing emails!

Physical Security: Cameras, locks, and keycards to protect actual physical stuff.

Asset Management: Knowing what you own (laptops, servers, software) so you can protect it.


🗓️ Study With Me Plan (The "Cute & Consistent" Method)
You can't cram this! Here's a gentle plan using only this repo.

Week	Focus Domain	Cute Activity
1	Domain 1	Read the notes. Write down the CIA Triad on a sticky note and put it on your mirror.
2	Domain 2 & 3	Go through the flashcards above. Make 5 new ones for terms you find tricky.
3	Domain 4 & 5	Explain what a firewall does to a friend (or your pet!). Doodle a picture of a network.
4	Review All	Re-read all the notes. Can you summarize each domain in one sentence?
5	Official Materials	Go through the FREE ISC2 CC Self-Paced Course. Take notes in a fun color.
6	Final Review	Test yourself with the flashcards again. You are so ready.
🌸 Final Encouragement
You are capable, you are smart, and you are going to pass this exam. Taking this step is incredible, and I'm so proud of you for starting this journey. Remember, every expert was once a beginner.

Good luck, future certified cybersecurity professional! 💖
