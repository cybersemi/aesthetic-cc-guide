# ✨ Oluwasemilogo’s Cybersecurity Notes ✨

Hi besties! 💖 My name is Oluwasemilogo, an aspiring cyber girlie from Lagos, Nigeria. I’m all about making an impact, spreading good vibes, and being 100% myself—because, yk, there’s only one me! 🌸

This repo is my cute and comprehensive guide to the ISC2 Certified in Cybersecurity (CC) exam. If you’re a fellow girlie (or anyone, really!) who wants to break into tech and cybersecurity, you’re in the right place. I’ve broken down the five CC domains in super simple language, so we can all learn, grow, and SLAY in cyber together. 🛡️💅

What’s Inside?

- Security Principles: Protecting info, keeping it accurate, and making sure only the right people have access.
- Business Continuity, Disaster Recovery & Incident Response: Keeping things running when stuff goes wrong, bouncing back, and learning from it.
- Access Controls: Who gets in, who stays out—online and IRL!
- Network Security: How computers talk, what can go wrong, and how we keep things safe.
- Security Operations: Making sure data is handled right, systems are up-to-date, and everyone’s in the know.

Whether you’re studying for the CC or just curious about cybersecurity, I hope these notes help you shine bright in tech. Stay fabulous, stay secure, and remember: you belong here! 💻✨

With love from Lagos,
Oluwasemilogo 💜
