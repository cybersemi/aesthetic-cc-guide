## 💁‍♀️ In a Nutshell

Imagine an exclusive club.
*   **Identification:** Showing your ID to prove your name. ("I'm Sarah.")
*   **Authentication:** The bouncer checking your ID is real and matches your face. ("Okay, you *are* Sarah.")
*   **Authorization:** The bouncer checking the guest list to see if Sarah is allowed in. ("Yep, you're on the list. You can come in.")
*   **Accounting:** The bouncer noting down the time Sarah entered and what section she went to. ("Sarah entered at 10:05 PM and went to the VIP lounge.")

This entire process of managing *who* is allowed *in* and *what* they can *do* is **Access Control**. It's the core of keeping things secure.

## 🔑 Key Concepts & Definitions

### The IAAA Framework (The Big Four)
This is the cornerstone of access control. Memorize this order!

1.  **Identification:** Claiming an identity.
    *   *Example:* A username, an email address, a badge number.
    *   *You say:* "I am `cyber-girl`."

2.  **Authentication:** Proving that identity.
    *   *How?* Using one or more of these factors:
        *   **Something you know:** Password, PIN.
        *   **Something you have:** Smart card, phone (for an app notification), hardware token.
        *   **Something you are:** Biometrics (fingerprint, retina scan, facial recognition).
    *   *The bouncer says:* "Prove it." You enter your password.
    *   **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):** Using **two or more** of the factors above. This is **significantly stronger** than just a password.

3.  **Authorization:** Determining what permissions and rights the authenticated identity has.
    *   *The bouncer says:* "Okay `cyber-girl`, you are authenticated. The list says you have 'Read-Only' access to the finances folder."
    *   *Principles:*
        *   **Least Privilege:** Give users only the absolute minimum level of access they need to do their jobs. (A junior accountant doesn't need access to the HR database).
        *   **Need to Know:** Even if you have a security clearance, you only get access to specific information necessary for your task.

4.  **Accounting (Auditing):** Tracking user activity.
    *   *Example:* Logs that record who accessed what file, when, and what they did with it (viewed, edited, deleted).
    *   This provides **non-repudiation**—a user cannot deny performing an action because the logs prove it.

### Types of Access Control Models
These are the rulebooks that systems use to decide who gets access.

| Model | How it works | Simple Example |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **DAC (Discretionary Access Control)** | The **owner** of the data decides who gets access. It's flexible but can be risky. | File permissions on your personal computer. You (the owner) can give anyone access to your folder. |
| **MAC (Mandatory Access Control)** | Access is decided by the **system**, based on labels and clearances. Used in high-security environments (military, government). | A document is labeled "Top Secret." Only users with a "Top Secret" clearance can access it. The user cannot change this. |
| **RBAC (Role-Based Access Control)** | Access is based on the **user's role** within the organization. This is very common in businesses. | All "Managers" have access to the budget report. All "Salespeople" have access to the customer database. |
| **ABAC (Attribute-Based Access Control)** | Access is based on **multiple attributes** (user, resource, environment). It's very dynamic and granular. | "A user (`attribute`) from the HR department (`attribute`) can access (`permission`) salary data (`resource`) only during work hours (`environment attribute`)." |

## 🎯 Exam Focus Points
*   **MEMORIZE the order and meaning of IAAA (Identification, Authentication, Authorization, Accounting).**
*   Know the **three factors of authentication** and that **MFA uses two or more**.
*   Understand the principle of **Least Privilege**.
*   Be able to differentiate between the main **access control models (DAC, MAC, RBAC)**.

## ❓ Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: What's the difference between Authentication and Authorization?**
> **A:** This is the #1 question! **Authentication** is about *verifying identity* ("Are you who you say you are?"). **Authorization** is about *verifying permissions* ("Now that I know who you are, what are you allowed to do?").

**Q: Is a username an example of Identification or Authentication?**
> **A:** **Identification.** It simply states who you claim to be. The password you type next is used for **Authentication**.

**Q: Which access control model is considered the most secure?**
> **A:** **Mandatory Access Control (MAC)** is considered the most secure because users cannot override or change the access rules set by the system administrator or security policy.

**Q: What is the main goal of the Least Privilege principle?**
> **A:** To **limit the blast radius** of an attack. If a user's account is compromised, the attacker only has a very limited set of permissions, minimizing the damage they can do.
