## 💁‍♀️ In a Nutshell

Imagine your house floods.
*   **Incident Response** is the step-by-step panic plan: *"Shut off the water main, call the plumber, start mopping!"*
*   **Disaster Recovery** is about fixing the house: *"Dry out the walls, replace the flooring, get everything back to normal."*
*   **Business Continuity** is about keeping your life running *during* the mess: *"Stay in a hotel, work from a café."*

This domain is all about having these plans ready *before* disaster strikes, so you don't just stand there screaming.

## 🔑 Key Concepts & Definitions

### ⚡ Incident Response (IR)
The organized approach to addressing and managing the aftermath of a security breach or cyberattack. The goal is to handle the situation in a way that limits damage and reduces recovery time and costs.

**The IR Process (The "Lifecycle"):**
1.  **Preparation:** The most important phase! Getting ready *before* an incident.
    *   *Activities:* Creating an IR plan, forming a CSIRT (Computer Security Incident Response Team), training staff, having tools ready.
2.  **Detection & Analysis:** Figuring out if something bad is happening and what it is.
    *   *Activities:* Monitoring alerts, investigating anomalies, determining the scope and impact.
3.  **Containment, Eradication, & Recovery:** Stopping the bleeding, kicking out the bad guy, and fixing things.
    *   **Containment:** Short-term (isolate a network segment) and long-term (apply a permanent fix).
    *   **Eradication:** Removing the cause (e.g., deleting malware).
    *   **Recovery:** Restoring systems and data to normal operation (e.g., from clean backups).
4.  **Post-Incident Activity:** Learning from the event.
    *   *Activities:* Writing a full report ("lessons learned"), updating policies and plans.

### 🌪️ Business Continuity (BC) & Disaster Recovery (DR)
Often used together, but they have distinct focuses.

| Concept | Primary Question | Focus | Example |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Business Continuity (BC)** | How do we keep the **business** running? | **People & Processes** | Having employees work from home during an office outage. |
| **Disaster Recovery (DR)** | How do we get our **technology** back? | **Technology & Data** | Restoring servers and data from a backup after a ransomware attack. |

**Key Terms:**
*   **RTO (Recovery Time Objective):** How *long* can a system be down? (The maximum acceptable downtime). *"We need the email server back within 4 hours."*
*   **RPO (Recovery Point Objective):** How much *data* can we afford to lose? (The maximum age of files that must be recovered). *"We can only lose 1 hour of data, so we need backups every hour."*
*   **MTD (Maximum Tolerable Downtime):** The total time the business can survive without the function. **RTO must be less than MTD.**

### 🔍 Digital Forensics
The application of science to the identification, collection, and analysis of digital data for use in legal proceedings.
*   **Key Principle:** Maintain the **chain of custody** – detailed documentation of who handled evidence, when, and why to ensure it's admissible in court.

## 🎯 Exam Focus Points
*   **MEMORIZE the 4 phases of the Incident Response lifecycle.**
*   Understand the critical difference between **BC** (keeping business running) and **DR** (getting tech back).
*   Know the difference between **RTO** (Time) and **RPO** (Data). This is a very common test question.
*   Know that **preparation** is the first and most critical step in IR.

## ❓ Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: What's the difference between an Event, an Incident, and a Disaster?**
> **A:**
> *   **Event:** Any observable occurrence. (e.g., a user clicks a phishing link).
> *   **Incident:** An event that has a negative consequence on security. (e.g., The phishing link installs malware).
> *   **Disaster:** A major incident that disrupts critical business functions for a period of time. (e.g., Ransomware encrypts the entire company).

**Q: Which is more important, a low RTO or a low RPO?**
> **A:** It depends on the business! A bank might have a very low RPO (they can't lose any transaction data). A news website might have a very low RTO (they can't be down for long, but can recreate content from notes).

**Q: What is the number one rule when collecting digital evidence?**
> **A:** Do not alter the original evidence. Work on a forensic copy. The **chain of custody** must be meticulously maintained.

**Q: Is having backups part of BC or DR?**
> **A:** Primarily **Disaster Recovery (DR)**, as it's a technical solution for restoring data and systems.
